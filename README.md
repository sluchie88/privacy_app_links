# Privacy App Links
### Stay safe out there folks, and fuck the corpos :feelsgood: :feelsgood: :feelsgood:
##### Except Best Buy

## Web browser
#### If you care about privacy and are using Chrome, you a fool.

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a very privacy centric browser. Tom approved.

Wanna go uber private? Try [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/). Onion links not included.


## Password Manager: Bitwarden

Its free. There's a browser extension, android and ios app. There's an app for your Apple watch, for christsake.

## Browser Extensions
### Organized by skill level

#### The Essential
[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/). This is the one I use, but really any will help.
[UBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/). Open source ad blocker. Are two ad blockers necessary? Not really.
[Privacy Badger](privacybadger.org). Learns to stop invisible trackers. Also, that name.
[Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/). Stops ads from loading from third parties. Further privacy.

#### The helpful, if annoying
Cookie Auto Delete. Deletes cookies on closing browser. You will have to log in unless you keep the browser open.
[Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh). [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)

Containers. These add-ons stop the companies from tracking outside their domain. I.e. the Amazon Container extension stops Amazon from tracking you across the web.
[Amazon Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/contain-amazon/)
[Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)
[Twitter Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-container/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
[Google Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/)
[Reddit Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-container/)

You get the idea. Search {Big tech company} Container and you'll likely find an extension.
