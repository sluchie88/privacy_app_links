## Web browser 
#### If you care about privacy and are using Chrome, you a fool.

:fire: :fire: :fire: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a very privacy centric browser. Tom approved.

## Browser Extensions
### Organized by skill level

#### The Essential
:feelsgood: [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/). This is the one I use, but really any will help.
:feelsgood: [UBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/). Open source ad blocker. Are two ad blockers necessary? Not really.
:feelsgood: [Privacy Badger](privacybadger.org). Learns to stop invisible trackers. Also, that name.
:feelsgood: [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/). Stops ads from loading from third parties. Further privacy.

#### The helpful, if annoying
:finnadie: Cookie Auto Delete. Deletes cookies on closing browser. You will have to log in unless you keep the browser open.

:finnadie: [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh) :finnadie:

:finnadie: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/) :finnadie:

Containers. These add-ons stop the companies from tracking outside their domain. I.e. the Amazon Container extension stops Amazon from tracking you across the web.
:goberserk: [Amazon Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/contain-amazon/)
:goberserk: [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)
:goberserk: [Twitter Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-container/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
:goberserk: [Google Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/)
:goberserk: [Reddit Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-container/)

You get the idea. Search {Big tech company} Container and you'll likely find an extension.
